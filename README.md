File Guard (Encryptor | Decryptor) is an extension that helps you easily secure your file(s) with the browser's built-in crypto API. 

This add-on has a simple and easy-to-use UI. Simply add it to your browser and start using it without any additional plugins. (1) load your file, (2) set a password, and (3) press on the encrypt/decrypt button. File Guard uses the new encryption API (WebCryptoAPI) which is built-in to your browser by default. If you want to encrypt a file, please first browser your file (drag & drop or use the file selector), then enter a password (2 times) and finally click on the - Encrypt - button. The add-on starts the encryption process and downloads the encrypted file to your machine automatically. Please do the same procedure for decryption purposes. 

Note: this addon is only designed for encrypting a "single" file. If you have a folder with multiple files or folders in it, please first "compress" your files to a single ".zip" file and then encrypt the compressed file with this add-on. Please note that File Guard can encrypt any file format with any size.

Note: if you forget the encryption password, you will not be able to recover (decrypt) your file with this add-on. Therefore, it is very important to keep your password in a safe place.
